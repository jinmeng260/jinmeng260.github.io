Do we really need the benchmark? People always use benchmark to compare systems. 
But benchmarks are misleading. The resources, e.g., CPU, disk, memory, network, 
all matter a lot. And with Seaweed File System, single node vs multiple nodes, 
benchmarking on one machine vs several multiple machines, all matter a lot.

Here is the steps on how to run benchmark if you really need some numbers.

## Unscientific Single machine benchmarking

I start weed servers in one console for simplicity. Better run servers on different consoles.

For more realistic tests, please start them on different machines.

```bash
# prepare directories
mkdir 3 4 5
# start 3 servers
./weed server -dir=./3 -master.port=9333 -volume.port=8083 &
./weed volume -dir=./4 -port=8084 &
./weed volume -dir=./5 -port=8085 &
./weed benchmark -server=localhost:9333
```

## What does the test do?

By default, the benchmark command would start writing 1 million files, each having 1KB size, uncompressed. 
For each file, one request is sent to assign a file key, and a second request is sent to post the file to the volume server. 
The written file keys are stored in a temp file.

Then the benchmark command would read the list of file keys, randomly read 1 million files. 
For each volume, the volume id is cached, so there is several request to lookup the volume id, 
and all the rest requests are to get the file content.

Many options are options are configurable. Please check the help content:

```bash
./weed benchmark -h
```

## Different Benchmark Target

The default "weed benchmark" uses 1 million 1KB file. This is to stress the number of files per second. 
Increasing the file size to 100KB or more can show much larger number of IO throughput in KB/second.

## My own replication 001 single machine results

Create benchmark volumes directly

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9333/vol/grow?collection=benchmark&count=3&replication=001&pretty=y"
# Later, after finishing the test, remove the benchmark collection
curl "http://localhost:9333/col/delete?collection=benchmark&pretty=y"
```

How can the replication 001 writes faster than no replication?
I could not tell. Very likely, the computer was in turbo mode. 
I can not reproduce it consistently either. Posted the number here just to illustrate that number lies. 
Don't quote on the exact number, just get an idea of the performance would be good enough.
